## User Roles and Permissions 👥

The platform supports three types of users:

1. Admin
   - Add new users to the system
   - Manage user permissions
2. Tech Users
   - Add and manage new Experts
   - Manage LLM integrations
   - Configure storage solutions
   - Manage Applications
3. Users (Employees)
   - Interact with general chat interfaces
   - Create and manage projects
   - Invite team members to projects
   - Utilize Experts within projects
   - Use Applications for specific tasks

## Key Features 🔑

### Projects 📂

- Dedicated spaces with custom knowledge bases
- Specific instructions for AI interactions
- Chat history preservation
- Team collaboration features

### Experts 🧠

- Company-wide AI assistants similar to CustomGPT
- Created and managed by tech users
- Utilize their own knowledge base and project-specific information
- Can be assigned to work on specific projects

### Applications 📱

- Small, task-specific LLM applications
- Designed for input-to-output operations (e.g., email rewriting, data structuring)
- Can be used across different projects

### Knowledge Management 📚

- Users can add outputs to project knowledge bases
- Option to download and export information

## MVP Phase 🚀

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following features:

- Web-based user interface
- Client user management with three role types (Admin, Tech User, User) + SaaS admin that creates client accounts.
- Project creation (with logo) and management - similar to claude.ai
- 4 pre-configured Experts with custom instructions and logo - similar to chatgpt customGPTs
- AWS storage integration
- ChatGPT 4o mini as the primary LLM provider
- Simulated LLM provider selection interface
- Basic chat functionality
- Application framework for input-to-output operations - similar to Google Gemini Gems (not for MVP)

Limitations in the MVP:

- No mid-conversation LLM provider switching - we will use only ChatGPT 4o mini
- Limited number of pre-configured Experts - no need to have working creator
- Single storage provider (AWS) - simulated choice and configurator of client storage

## Future Plans 📈

Planned enhancements for future versions include:

- Support for multiple LLM providers with easy integration
- Expanded storage options (Azure, Google Cloud, and others)
- Advanced Expert creator with agent system capabilities
- Integration of other AI services beyond LLMs (e.g., LLama, Gemini, Runway, Midjourney)
- Multi-language support for interface and AI interactions
- Enhanced security and compliance features
- Cross-AI analytics and reporting (v3)
- Potential integrations with enterprise tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce) (v3)

## Integration Process 🔄

Enterprise clients can quickly set up and start using the system by following these steps:

1. Sign up for an account
2. Invite users and assign roles
3. Add LLM API credentials (simulated in MVP)
4. Configure storage solution (AWS in MVP, more options in future versions)
5. Upload company logo
6. Ready. Start creating projects and using the platform

The simplicity of adding their own tech stack is a key feature, allowing for rapid deployment and experimentation. (after MVP)

## Technical Architecture 🏗️

The platform is designed as a web application with the following key components:

- Frontend: Responsive web interface
- Backend: API-driven architecture
- Storage: Client-side data storage (AWS in MVP, expandable in future)
- LLM Integration: API-based connections to LLM providers
- Security: Enterprise-grade security measures (to be expanded in future versions)

## Security and Compliance 🔒

While the MVP focuses on core functionality, future versions will address advanced security and compliance requirements, potentially including:

- GDPR compliance
- HIPAA compliance
- SOC 2 certification
- End-to-end encryption
- Advanced access controls
- Audit logging

## Limitations and Considerations ⚠️

- The MVP simulates some features (e.g., LLM provider selection) to demonstrate future capabilities
- Switching LLM providers mid-conversation is not supported
- The platform acts as an aggregator and does not provide its own LLM capabilities
- Fine-tuning of models is not handled by the platform; clients can connect their own fine-tuned models
- Data scaling is primarily handled on the client side due to the use of client storage solutions

This documentation will be updated as the product evolves, new features are added, and additional capabilities are introduced.
